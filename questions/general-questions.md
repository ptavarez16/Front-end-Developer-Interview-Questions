# General Questions:

* What did you learn yesterday/this week?

* What excites or interests you about coding?
  - What interests me the most about coding is always being in the position to learn something new. Being able to pick up a new tool and apply it to an application to solve a problem is a such a thrilling feeling. The challenge of solving a problem through research takes patience, but once you find the right answer it brings with it a great high!

  -
* Can you explain any common techniques or recent issues solved in regards to front-end security?

* What actions have you personally taken on recent projects to increase maintainability of your code?
  - To maintain my code, one thing I am a huge fan of is version control. With git, I commit frequently to ensure I have backups to all of my code. If I break something, I can easily jump back in time and go back to code I know works.
  Writing clean and legible code is also key in increasing maintainability. I strive to write code that I anyone will be able to see and know exactly what's going on.
* Talk about your preferred development environment.
  - Tech:
    - I'll like to be part of a team that follows the three server tiers, called development, staging and production (DSP).
    During the developer server, developers test code and check whether the application runs successfully with that code. Once everything is running smoothly, the it's time to move to the staging server.
    The staging server is optimized to look and work just like the production server. This step is to reinforce testing and confirm that the new code does not break the old code or cause new bugs. Once this is approved by the team to deploy, it's off to the production server.
    The production server is the last step. Once the approval is done, the application then becomes part of this server.
