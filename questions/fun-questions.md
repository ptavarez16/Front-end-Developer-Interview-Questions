# Fun Questions:

### What's a cool project that you've recently worked on?
If asked this question, talk about the project you've most recently worked on and why you've enjoyed working on it. Name any new technologies you used, and any challenges you faced and overcame.

### What are some things you like about the developer tools you use?
I have biased opinions with the dev tools I use because I mainly use Chrome DevTools, but I feel like for the most part they are all very similar, aiming to help developers test and debug their code.

Chrome DevTools makes it really easy to view and change a page's style. Developers are able to see how the browser is actually applying styles to HTML elements. Changes to styles applies the changes immediately without needing to reload your page.

Debugging with `console.log()`! Developers can pause in the middle of a page's execution and step through the code one line at a time. While paused, one can inspect (and even change) the current values of variables at that point in time.

Although I do not use it much, the Audits panel provides quantitative reports of your site speed, as well as concrete tips on how to improve it. It's a really cool tool that I want to get more experience with.

### Do you have any pet projects? What kind?
Right now I am working on a fitness goal. I have been waking up with chest pains and get tired very easily, so I have been doing a lot more cardio and eating better.

### What's your favorite feature of Internet Explorer?
There's no feature I like when it comes to internet explorer because I never use it lol. Any time I do try to use, I feel like throwing up. Even so, I understand that many people use this browser, so I try to make sure anh features on one of my pages works well across all browsers.

### How do you like your coffee?
I like my coffee with flavored cream and sugar. My favorite creamer is Coffee-Mate's Caramel Macchiato.
